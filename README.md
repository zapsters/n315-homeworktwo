# Homework Two

## Purpose

This assignment will help you understand the MVC model and how to implement it into a application.

## Instructions

If you don't understand what MVC is or how to use it, watch the class lectures and read the articles I posted in the Homework 2 overview.
You will be creating an application that is set up the way I have shown you for a simple MVC project.
Make sure you use npm to create your project and that you have a package.json file
You need to create four links in the navigation that, when clicked on, display that page's information in the content area of the site. (So when I click on the About link, the information on the page goes away, and the About information is put in its place).
You can create any page and design that you like, but you must have four pages, and they must contain images and text. Lorem is fine to use.
Upload this to the web 4 server and to Github as well. Remember to add to. your Readme file and put the link to Web 4 inside the Readme file.
Submit the Github link to this assignment.
